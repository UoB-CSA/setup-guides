# JetBrains Educational License

Many JetBrains IDEs require a license to access (e.g. IntelliJ Ultimate, GoLand, CLion). University students are eligible for a free educational license which they can apply for using their `@bristol.ac.uk` email address. This license will last one year but can be extended yearly so long as the student still has access to a university email account.
