# Setup instructions for Windows

**We recommend using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).**

1. If you already have WSL setup you can skip this step. Setup WSL by following steps 1, 2 and 3 from [Tilo's Windows setup guide](http://people.cs.bris.ac.uk/~burghard/setup/windows.html).

2. Open a new Ubuntu terminal and follow the [linux setup guide](./linux.md) to install Go.
